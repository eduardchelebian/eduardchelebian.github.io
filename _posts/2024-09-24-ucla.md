Arrived in Los Angeles for a three-month research visit to UCLA! ‚òÄÔ∏èüå¥

I‚Äôll be collaborating with Professor [Amjad Askary's lab](https://amjad.mcdb.ucla.edu/) in the [Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology](https://www.mcdb.ucla.edu/), focusing on integrating imaging and spatial transcriptomics to identify distinct progenitor cell classes in the retina. My role will involve obtaining morphological characteristics from images using computer vision and combining them with spatial omics.

Looking forward to both learning from and contributing to the research happening here at UCLA!
