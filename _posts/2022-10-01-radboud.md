title: 'Research visit to Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands'
---

This week I finished my research visit to the [Computational Pathology group](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/) at the Radboud university medical center (Radboudumc) and I can only say positive things about the experience. During these three months, I had the opportunity to explore deep neural network representations in histology imaging by developing an interactive cancer annotation tool (so stay tuned for that!). I really enjoy these kinds of exchanges where you see how people in different groups approach research, in this case always keeping the focus on clinical application.

I want to especially thank [Francesco Ciompi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DOErev8AAAAJ&hl=en) for supervising my work during the visit and my Ph.D. supervisor [Carolina WÃ¤hlby](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=17soDRoAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1) for supporting me in the process. I am sure this can be the beginning of a great collaboration and I'd be very happy to see our projects come to a positive conclusion.

And also thanks to everyone in the broader Diagnostic Image Analysis Group! It's genuinely a group of nice and fun people doing important work for the future of AI in medical analysis. So if you want to know more about their work, go ahead and visit their website: [www.diagnijmegen.nl](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/).
