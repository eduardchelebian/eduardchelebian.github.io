title: 'PhD half-time seminar: Leveraging network representations for cancer histopathology and spatial-omics'
---

In Sweden, two-years into your PhD, you have to present a half-time seminar, where you explain what have you done so far and what are you planning to do. In my case, I have been exploring how deep network representations of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides describe tissue morphology. Some of the work includes correlating them with spatial gene expression and using them for interactive annotation. Work in progress also includes using representations on other microscopy images and using them in a weakly supervised framework.

Below a short summary:
