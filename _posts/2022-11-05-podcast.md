Yesterday I participated in the virtual summit [Bridging the gap between Pathology and Computer Science](https://digitalpathologyplace.com/events/bridging-the-gap-between-pathology-and-computer-science/), where I was interviewed by Alexandra Zuraw from [*The Pathology Place*](https://digitalpathologyplace.com/).

I spoke about what spatially resolved gene expression is, why is it important to relate it to histopathology and what are some current applications. Some references I mentioned were [Nature Methods of the Year 2020 paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-020-01033-y), our [previous work](https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13194837) where we correlate morphological features with spatial transcriptomics profiles, using [this model](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(19)30738-7) and [this dataset](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05023-2).
