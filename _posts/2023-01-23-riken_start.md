title: 'Start of my research visit at RIKEN, Yokohama!'
---

Already been a week since I arrived in Yokohama! 

Coming to Japan has been a long-awaited goal for me and now I have the opportunity of spending three months here at the [RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Science (IMS)](https://www.ims.riken.jp/english/) as a visiting researcher. 
During my time in the Laboratory for Genome Information Analysis, I will further explore the use of artificial intelligence to study the connection and integration between microscopy images and gene expression, in particular spatial transcriptomics and single-cell sequencing, under the supervision of [Chung Chau Hon](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=35q1rEEAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW). 

And of course, I am really looking forward to learning more about the Japanese culture, scientific and otherwise!
