DEPICTER is an interactive tool for annotating histopathology images based on self-supervised learning representations. Implemented in TissUUmaps, it offers browser-based and GPU-accelerated capabilities.

We tested it with pathologists to provide real-time user experience metrics for estimating annotation effort when using DEPICTER.

We evaluated on three large-scale cancer benchmarks achieving competitive results and showing how DEPICTER can be used broadly.
